			50+ Love Text Messages
			Meeting you was the best day of my life.
			When you are next to me, or when we are apart, You are always the first in my thoughts and in my heart.
			I never ever thought I’d like you this much and I never planned to have you on my mind this often.
			I love the way you love me.
			Spring drops and the sun outside the window tell me that this spring will be the flowering of our love.
			I can’t spend a day without you, can’t you see? I love you so much. You are a part of me and this is forever.
			You make me happy in a thousand ways. I love you to the moon and back, and I have no idea what I would do, if I lost you, because I feel like I will lose my entire world.
			Nothing is going change my love for you, you are the man, who helped me to find myself in this life.
			I can’t imagine living a life without you. You are my reason to be.
			The wind whispers your name, stars illuminate my way to you, we will meet soon, love you!
			I couldn’t even imagine being happy before I met you. Now I’m the vision of contentment.
			It is said that only together with a real man a woman can bloom and enjoy life, I feel like the most beautiful flower on the planet because I am with you! Thank you for your love.
			Love for you is in my blood, it flows through my veins, and fills me with energy. I love you.
			Every day I want to have you next to me, When you’re not here, I’m always sad, When you are here, my heart is full of joy, I never want to lose you.
			When I look into the night sky with thousands of stars, I remember your eyes, because they sparkle exactly like stars. When I see the sun I remember you because you brighten not just my day, but my life.
			Do you know who really loves you? The person, who secretly prays for you to God. I love you very much.
			I’m a much better person because of knowing love, and you’re why I know love.
			Meeting you was like an answer to a prayer, I became happier, my heart always feels good, I feel good, and I know for sure, you feel good as well.
			This spring will crown all the splendor of our love, and we will become a loving family!
			Being around you is the definition of pure love, joy, and happiness.
			My love, you brighten up my day with your smile, it always takes my breath away.
			If I could be with you forever, I’d be the happiest person alive.
			Even the sunniest day, met without you, becomes sullen. Only your love paints all around with bright colors.
			Love is my everything. It’s everywhere. It’s in the messages you send me, it’s in the words you say to me and it’s in your eyes when you look at me. Love is in my heart and in my thoughts. Love is you and me.
			I have never thought that three words would change my life completely. I love you and I am ready to shout about it to everyone!
			Words aren’t enough to tell you how wonderful you are. I love you.
			You make my heart melt!
